<body>
<p>
  Long hair across the room, 
Baby she got that glow
I know you see me over here, 
So dance on me real slow
We've been goin' for about two hours 
And I don't even know your name
So baby please reveal, reveal
</p>
<p>
  Your friends are callinâ€™ you baby 
Stay with me instead
I know ya sayin' that you're tired 
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go 
I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, 
Good time we had.
