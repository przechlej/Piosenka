<h1>ODESZA - Across the Room (ft. Leon Bridges)<h1>
<p>
  Long hair across the room, 
Baby she got that glow
I know you see me over here, 
So dance on me real slow
We've been goin' for about two hours 
And I don't even know your name
So baby please reveal, reveal
</p>
<p>
  Your friends are callin’ you baby 
Stay with me instead
I know ya sayin' that you're tired 
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go 
I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, 
Good time we had. 
</p>
<p>
The scent of your perfume 
Has got me lost in a haze
And oh this moment depends 
On the records that the DJ plays
Baby move a lil bit closer 
Because I wanna feel you babe
I wanna feel you babe 
</p>
